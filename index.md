I am a programmer who finds programming really hard and I have to spend way more time on my peers to accomplish the same tasks. **That makes me _sad_**

Outside of being stressed at school, I enjoy the following:
- *skating*
- *gaming*
- *fashion*
- *laying on the floor*
  - staring at the ceiling 
- *talking to friends*

>huh

Here are some foods I'm willing to eat
1. ice cream
2. ***hot chip***
3. tapioca pudding
4. ~~hersheys~~ cookies n creme 


##### i can't handle my current work and i'm so stressed and i feel so helpless haha
